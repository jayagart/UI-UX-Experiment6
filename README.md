# UI-UX-Experiment6

## Aim:
To practice solution ideation, user story creation, scenario development, flow mapping, and information architecture design to improve user experience through structured UX design activities.

## Algorithm:

1. Start the UX design process by selecting the target application (Hospital Appointment Booking App).

2. Perform solution ideation by listing multiple possible features and improvements for the app.

3. Create user stories using the standard format:
   - "As a ___, I want ___, so that ___."

4. Choose one important user story and develop a scenario that describes how a real user interacts with the app.

5. Create a task flow diagram representing the sequence of steps the user follows to complete the selected task.

6. Conduct open card-sorting to understand how users group information.

7. From the grouped data, create the Information Architecture (IA) showing main categories and sub-categories.

8. Review all outputs (ideation, user stories, scenario, flow, IA) to ensure clarity, consistency, and alignment with user needs.

9. Finalize and save all documents for GitHub submission.
